# NoNitroEmoji
- Essentialy its a selfbot. You can send emojis as links/attachments, download all emojis from a server, search for emojis in files and servers and so on.

# Why?
- I made this because my nitro expired and I still wanted to use emojis. You can get banned for this as it is a selfbot, I will not be held responsible for any use of this program.
